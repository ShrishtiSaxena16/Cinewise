Cinewise is a movie recommendation system that helps users find films that align with their tastes. Itâ€™s an easy way to discover new movies based on your personal taste. 
Using content-based filtering, it looks at details like the cast, genre, keywords, and storyline of each movie to suggest similar films to the ones a user already enjoys.
